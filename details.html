    <h1>Greenpoint Loft</h1>
    <p><a href="https://www.greenpointloft.com/">Greenpoint Loft</a> is an old converted rope factory in Greenpoint, a neighborhood in Brooklyn. It shares an entrance with the Greenpoint Terminal Gallery and a number of other small businesses. There will be signs and someone stationed in the lobby to help you get up to the space, and there is an elevator. </p>

    <h1>Other Events</h1>
    <p><b>Saturday, April 30th</b> most likely between <b>11am and 3pm</b> (or so), we'll be having a welcome picnic/get together/celebration/whatever. If you've come in from out of town, if you've got the day off, or if you are just very, very set on maximizing your time with us, we are planning on grabbing a large space in the Brooklyn Bridge Pier Parks, near <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Xbh37euZUVnymZhAA">Pier 5</a> specifically. We'll bring pastries and coffee and other goodies for a late brunch affair.  This is very optional and very casual, but we'd love to see you! </p>

    <h1>Transportation</h1>
    <p>This comes as no surprise, but <i>we strongly recommend you use public transit to get around NYC</i>. The Greenpoint Avenue stop of the <font color="green">G</font> train is about a 5 - 10 minute walk away. This will take you most of downtown Brooklyn, and connects to approximately every other subway line in the city. Fares on all NYC trains and busses (but not the airport AirTrain, grrr) can be accessed by contact-less credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and similar.</p>
    
    <p>If you have never used the NYC subway, and are nervous about doing so, please reach out to us! We'd love to help you plan your trip - provided you do so before that weekend. For the most part, Google Maps is stellar about NYC transit, including live arrival times for trains and busses, up to the minute service changes, and every time Sasha thinks he can outsmart it, he finds himself incorrect. For those who may be concerned: crime on city transit, especially in central areas like Greenpoint, is incredibly rare. You are very likely in more danger driving to the airport in your hometown than you are sitting on the subway. If you are lost and confused and stuck somewhere underground - ask a stranger for help. New Yorkers are, as stereotypes suggest, more brusque and to the point than most Americans, but cannot resist showing off how much they know about getting around the city. And if they tell you wrong, someone (or 5 someones) will jump in to correct them. </p>

    <p>If you prefer, the <a href="https://www.ferry.nyc/routes-and-schedules/route/east-river/">NYC ferry</a> runs every 50 minutes on weekends from lower Manhattan and Midtown. At the moment, the Greenpoint stop of the ferry is closed for repairs, but they are promising it will open by May. Realistically, though, the North Williamsburg stop is a 15-20 minute walk along the water from Greenpoint Loft. </p>
    
    <p><em>A Note for Drivers:</em> The yearly 5 Boro Bike Tour is happeneing the same day as the wedding. We strongly suspect it will be long over by the time you would be arriving to the venue, and the route has not been posted yet, but in previous years, it has gone down nearby Franklin Street. A friendly heads up to check travel times and road closures. The nearby MPG Parking garage is recommended by the venue, though we have never used it. </p>

    <h1>Lodging</h1>
    <p>We do not have a block of rooms reserved anywhere - we know that many of our guests have friends and family in the NYC area and are going to be trying to intersect with them, and we also know that coming to NYC is expensive for many people in the first place and budgets on lodging will vary greatly. Conveniently, NYC has more hotel rooms than any other city in the country and there is sure to be something that meets your needs. For convenience to the venue, we recommend staying in Williamsburg or Downtown Brooklyn near the G train. For convenience to more tourist attractions, we recommend Manhattan. See the NYC page for ideas and suggestions. </p>
