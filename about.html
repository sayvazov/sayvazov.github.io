	My name is Sasha, and I am currently a Ph.D. student at UC San Diego, in the 
	Mathematics Department, with a specialization in Computational Science, Mathematics, 
	and Engineering. This is my second year, and I am currently working on application 
	of variational and geometric integration methods.

	<p>
	I am a programmer, both in my day to day work and in my spare time. Currently, 
	most of my work involves high performance computational code in C++, with an 
	emphasis on parallel performance. In my spare time, I get to play around with
	a lot less mathy code.

	I am obsessed with interactive computing. 
	I used to work as a web developer, and I have been playing around for a few 
	years with for Microsoft's Kinect sensor and HTC's Vive VR system. 
	As an undergrad, I worked a lot in theater and designed static and interactive
	projections for theater and dance performances. 
	I've also spent a lot of time tinkering with Arduinos and other forms of embedded computing. 
	</p>
	<p>
	My primary interest, both as a programmer and as a person, is in transforming the 
	way that people see the world around them using technology.
