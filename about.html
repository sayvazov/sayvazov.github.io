			Who Am I? What Am I Doing Here? Why Did I Make This?

			<p>My name is Sasha. I'm pretty cool, I think. But don't take my word for it. My mom thinks I'm pretty cool, too. Now that's a reliable source.</p> 
			<p>I'm a first year graduate student at UCSD, working on a Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics. 
			I'm currently reading my way up to maybe knowing what's going on in numerical PDEs, neural networks, and other
			intersections of mathematics, computer science, and (just maybe) the real world. </p>
			<p>I did my undergrad at the University of Chicago where, among other things, I worked as a web design assistant and did way too much theater.
			I double majored in Math and English Literature, proving that no matter how much I complain, I will never leave the warm embrace of academia.</p>
			<p> In other news, my neural network is taking a long time to train. Which is why I'm wasting time and making this website. 
			Who knows, maybe someday there'll be something cool here. For now, there really isn't.
